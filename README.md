📌 Here are the key points of implementing this task: 

1- Using flex columns to organize the data of each month next to each other.  
2- Using inside each array item flex rows so the data is displayed below each other.  
3- Wrapping these implementations in an array mapping to display all array items with the month name displayed below.  
4- Won/lost height display: multiplying the value (won/lost) by a variable (h) to illustrate the number through height.  
5- Hovering: I used the hovering technique so upon hovering on any part of an item it displays the number of won/lost legal cases in a div attached to the cursor.  
6- Slight responsiveness additions: because it is only one component without much details, I just made the text (Bar Chart) and the items width slightly smaller when the screen is small.
